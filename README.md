# LearningDjango
I'm embarking on a journey to learn Django! This repository marks the beginning of my coding adventure, serving as a space to store project code while I explore Git and Github for version control. Join me in this learning process as I share my code, aiming to contribute to the community and facilitate collaborative learning.
